#Background
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

##Identifier Variables
1) subject_id - unique identifier for each subject; labeled 1-30
2) activity_type - activity type labeled: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

##Features
The source originally had 561 feature variables.In the cleaned data set, there are 79 feature variables that describe the mean or standard deviation of a feature.
